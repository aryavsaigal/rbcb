# really bad chess board
inefficient and barely working chess board and move validator written in rust

try it at your own risk and dont use this in place of a better implemented and updated chess board validator

## how it works
honestly, this is a really bad implementation

as an exercise to the reader, you can go through the source code and figure out the implementation

ps: as a bonus, i did not leave any comments, all the best!
